_(That's How I Roll)_

### Open Source Aquarium Roll Filter

*THIR* is a build it yourself roll-filter for your aquarium.

### About THIR

Automatic roll filters are generally very expensive to buy and maintain despite the cost of materials and construction techniques being relatively cheap and easy to undertake. The idea of *THIR* is to design and make available plans for an automatic roll filter that anyone can put together at home. 

### How do Roll Filters work?

Automatic roll filters use a long strip of filter media wound onto a roll, much like a toilet roll. The media is unwound from the roll and water is passed through it causing particulates and waste to become trapped in the media, allowing the cleaned filtered water to continue on. When the media becomes blocked new media is then automatically indexed off of the roll presenting clean media to the water flow. the used media is would onto a waste roll where it is collected until the filter roll has been used.

### Why do we need yet another roll filter?

There are many examples of roll filters now on the market, with a variety of designs, some good, some bad. Having been an early adopter of roll filters I discovered that there were lots of improvements that needed to be made to the unit I had before it could really be considered reliable. In fact I ended up redesigning pretty much all of it.

It was whilst I was on this journey of repair and rebuild that I realised that paying several hundred dollars for a few dollars worth of perspex, an inferior design and a cheap $2 motor was an absolute travesty. Especially when I did not even manage to get to the end of the first filter roll before the machine broke. So I had the idea of making an improved roll filter and selling it. 

Fast forwards two years and I still haven't gotten around to making roll filters. So I thought that perhaps instead of selling filters, I should simply give the design away and allow others to build on the work I had already done.

### Basic design constraints

- The design is a simple clear perspex box with an open top.
- There are perches on the top of the box to hold a filter roll and waste roll.
- Media is transported from the media roll to the waste roll by driving the waste roll
- The media is passed around removable rollers at the bottom of the box so that the media is presented against the inside faces of the box
- Rollers are removable to aid with roll change
- There are holes in the faces of the box to allow water to pass through the media and out of the box
- The waste roller is driven by a 2 or 3 rpm motor and gearbox.
- The motor is operated by a simple float switch
- Design should be scalable so that it can be made larger / smaller to suit different tanks / flow rates
- Design should be easily removable / dismantle-able to aid cleaning and roll changes
- Design should be easy to assemble and very importantly easy to get square!!!

### Roll filter media

One of the biggest complaints about roll filters is the cost of the media. I have been running weed matting in my machine for about the past year with no issues. Weed matting comes on a 900/1000mm wide roll. I simply cut the roll into appropriately size smaller rolls which fit into my machine. I tried a variety of different materials including 'interfacing' commonly used in dressmaking and quilting as well as other non-woven fibers.

You may need to experiment a little to find a suitable local source. I found that getting a sample of the material and then doing a simple 'tap test' was enough to determine how well the material flowed water. Some materials did not pass water at all and the water simply rolled off. This was especially true of some of the 'interfacing' fabrics which contained a heat activated glue. These were obviously no good.

We also analysed the fabric under a microscope to determine the size of the holes. Being a non-woven fabric the holes are irregularly sized so you need to do some a bit of mathematics and average out the sizes. 

We found that that a 10 micron filter roll was almost too small, especially when used on a small unit like our test, The filter roll ended up consumed very quickly. The 'weed matting' material we found was just a generic non-woven material sold as 'weed matting' It was available in white and also a dark grey colour. We elected to use the white so that the residue was easier to see. Under the microscope we noted that the material had holes as large as 60 microns, but that most of the holes were much smaller. This worked really well on our machine and did not result with the roll getting consumed to quickly.
